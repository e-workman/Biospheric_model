# Biospheric_model

Model written to simulate the biosphere with the aim to find the total evapotranspiration and the mean carbon uptake under three different conditions: plants are not limited by soil water, soil water limits stomatal conductance or soil water limits photosynthesis.

"Biospheric Model Description.pdf": contains the exercise which the code was based off and the equations which were used in the model.

"Biospheric Model Report.pdf": is the report of the analysis of the mean carbon uptake and total evapotranspiration under the three scenarios of interest. The output of the model can be found here.
